Real-Time Respiratory Health Monitoring Using Audio & Wearables

RespWear is an AI-driven real-time respiratory health monitoring system that integrates respiratory audio analysis and wearable sensor data to detect breathing abnormalities. The project combines embedded IoT hardware, mobile/wearable sensing, and machine learning to deliver a low-cost, portable, and efficient respiratory monitoring solution suitable for home care, fitness, elder care, and early diagnosis support.

📌 Project Overview

RespWear aims to continuously monitor a user’s breathing through:
✔ Audio signals (captured via MEMS microphone)
✔ Physical chest movement data (from IMU accelerometer & gyroscope)

By fusing these two data streams, the system can detect:

Irregular breathing cycles

Heavy/exerted breathing

Coughing events

Motion-induced breathing disturbances

Potential apnea indicators

Abnormal respiratory patterns during exercise or rest

The project demonstrates how lightweight machine learning models can be deployed on embedded hardware for real-time inference, enabling proactive respiratory health monitoring without external cloud dependencies.

🔧 Hardware Components

The RespWear prototype uses:

ESP32-S3 Microcontroller – for real-time processing & wireless transmission

ICS-43434 MEMS Microphone – high-quality respiratory sound acquisition

BMI160 IMU Sensor – motion, acceleration & chest-expansion tracking

Li-Ion Battery – portable power

Custom wearable band / chest strap – holds sensors in place
